# Trump Sentiment Analysis
Repo for my [written post](https://benjamingrayzel.substack.com/publish/post/147826016) on Trump's sentiment before and after the attempt on his life.

All text is in the speeches directory. The relevant script to run VADER on each speech is "script," which creates the speech_sentiments.csv file. The visualizations "both.png, diff.png, and neg.png" were formed in trump_speech_sentiment.R.
