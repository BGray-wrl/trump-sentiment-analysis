AND BY THE WAY, WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD POLLS COMING OUT TODAY I JUST HEARD. DESPITE ALL THE FAKE PUBLICITY ABOUT THIS RADICAL LEFT PERSON FROM SAN FRANCISCO. HOW'S SAN FRANCISCO DOING? NOT LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. WE HAVE SOME VERY GOOD POLLS COMING OUT. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY DO. I MEAN, WHAT THEY DO, WHAT THE FAKE NEWS IS ABLE TO DO. AND YET WE ARE LEADING. AND LET THEM HAVE THEIR CONVENTION, AND WHO KNOWS HOW THAT IS GOING TO TURN OUT. JOE BIDEN IS A VERY ANGRY MAN. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? BECAUSE THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM. THEY USURPED IT. TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. I'M NOT SURE THEY PICKED THE RIGHT GUY IN HIM, BUT HE GOT 14 MILLION VOTES. YOU GOT NO VOTES. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. THEY ARE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AS THEY SAY. THEY ARE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. BUT THANKS AS WELL TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, CHUCK EDWARDS OF VIRGINIA, FOX WARRIORS, THANK YOU WHEREVER YOU MAY BE. THANK YOU, VIRGINIA. STATE AUDITOR CANDIDATE -- I AM ONLY IN POLITICS FOR YOU, DAVE. DAVE, IF YOU SAY THAT -- DO YOU MEAN THAT? HE HAS MY ENDORSEMENT. [CHUCKLES] A MAN WHO IS DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB, SO GOOD WHEN WE WON THIS STATE AND WE WON EASILY. MICHAEL 2HATLEY, 2OU 2RE 2OING TO HEAD THE RNC WITH LARA, WITH LARA. AND THEY'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE JOB. ALSO YOUR NORTH CAROLINA GOP CHAIRMAN JASON SIMMONS. YOU DOING OK? WE'RE DOING GOOD, JASON. WE'RE WAY UP HERE, WE GOTTA MAKE SURE EVERYONE GETS OUT AND VOTE, BUT WE'RE WAY UP. WE WON EVERY TIME WE RAN. SPECIAL PLACE. MY SON, YOU KNOW, HE AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE, YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. LARA. LARA. ERIC AND LARA NAMED THEIR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER CAROLINA. I SAID, WHICH ONE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WELL, TODAY I'M GONNA SAY IT'S NORTH CAROLINA. NO. SHE WAS BORN HERE, RAISED HERE, SHE'S GREAT, SHE'S REALLY TERRIFIC. HE'S A GREAT YOUNG MAN. I AM PREJUDICED PERHAPS BECAUSE HE IS MY SON A LITTLE BIT, BUT THEY ARE A GREAT COUPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE APPRECIATE IT. WITH THE HELP OF EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM, 83 DAYS FROM NOW -- CAN YOU IMAGINE? 83 DAYS, WE'RE ALMOST THERE. WE GOTTA GET IT. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT SUPER LIBERAL, MORE LIBERAL THAN BERNIE SANDERS, DID YOU HEAR THAT? THE MOST LIBERAL PERSON IN THE SENATE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? WE'RE GONNA DEFEAT KAMALA HARRIS . WE'RE GOING TO WIN BACK THE WHITE HOUSE IN A HISTORICAL LANDSLIDE. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT BACK. AND I THINK IT'S TO SAY, AND I NEVER GET CORRECTED. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF I AM SLIGHTLY OFF, THEY DO THOSE HEADLINES. WELL, WE ARE LEADING THE BIGGEST POLITICAL MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. BIGGER THAN ANY MOVEMENT EVER BEFORE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT LIKE THIS. IT'S CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. MAGA. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I SAY TO THE DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY COME OUT HERE, WE'VE GOT TO STOP MAGA. MAGA IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHAT YOU WANT TO STOP IT FOR? THEY PUT IN A CANDIDATE AND WE BEAT HIM. BADLY. HOW DID HE DO IN THE DEBATE? THEN THEY PUT IN ANOTHER CANDIDATE. THIS IS LIKE YOU HAVE TWO FIGHTERS. ONE GUY IS LOSING YOU SAY COME ON OUT, LET'S PUT IN ANOTHER ONE. SO THEN, UHH, THEY PUT IN ANOTHER CANDIDATE, AND WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT SHE HAS THE GREATEST PRESS. SHE WENT FROM BEING TOTALLY DISRESPECTED PERSON SIX WEEKS AGO, NOBODY THOUGHT SHE HAD A CHANCE -- AND I DON'T THINK SHE CAN POSSIBLY WIN/. IF SHE DOES, OUR COUNTRY IS FINISHED. TOTALLY DISRESPECTED. THE MOST UNPOPULAR VICE PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THEN THEY DECIDED TO GET POLITICALLY CORRECT. THEY PUT HER IN, NOW THEY ARE PUTTING HER ON THE COVERS OF TIME MAGAZINE WITH AN ARTIST SKETCH. THEY DON'T USE A PICTURE. THEY DON'T USE A PICTURE, THEY USE AN ARTIST SKETCH. I WANT TO USE THAT ARTIST. I WANT TO FIND THAT ARTIST, I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BEAT HER ALSO, THEN THEY MAY GET A THIRD CANDIDATE, WHO KNOWS. THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. WE SPENT PROBABLY $100 MILLION ON BEATING HIM. THEN WE HAD A VERY GOOD DEBATE AND WE BEAT HIM AND THEY SAID, WELL, INSTEAD OF LETTING IT GO -- WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS, IT'S THE WORLD OF POLITICS. THEY SAID WE WANT HIM OUT. JOE, YOU'RE GETTING HIM OUT. I DON'T WANT TO GET OUT. JOE, YOU'RE GETTING OUT NOW. WE CAN DO IT THE NICE WAY OR WE CAN DO IT THE HARD WAY. AND HE'S GETTING OUT. HE'S GETTING OUT. IN FACT THEY ARE EVEN GIVING HIM A GOOD SPOT TO SPEAK. THEY ARE SPEAKING ON MONDAY. THAT IS THE WORST DAY. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. IT IS THEIR OWN FORM OF -- I GUESS IT IS A MINOR FORM OF CHEATING IN COMPARISON TO WHAT THEY REALLY DO. EVERYTHING KAMALA HARRIS TOUCHES TURNS BAD. IT ALL TURNS BAD. SAN FRANCISCO WAS A GREAT CITY. NOW IT IS UNLIVABLE. CALIFORNIA WAS A GREAT STATE, NOW IT IS UNLIVABLE. SHE BREAKS EVERYTHING JUST LIKE SHE BROKE THE BORDER, BROKE OUR ECONOMY. BUT SOON WE ARE GOING TO FIX EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN HAVE CREATED AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AMERICA. NOW, THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DAY. THIS IS TALKING ABOUT A THING CALLED THE ECONOMY. I WANTED TO DO A SPEECH ON THE ECONOMY. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY DEVASTATED I WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH INFLATION AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS. SO WE ARE DOING THIS AS AN INTELLECTUAL SPEECH. YOU ARE ALL INTELLECTUALS TODAY. TODAY WE ARE DOING IT, AND WE ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THEY SAY IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT. I THINK CRIME IS RIGHT THERE, I THINK THE BORDER IS RIGHT THERE, PERSONALLY. WE HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT SUBJECTS BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS BECOME A THIRD WORLD NATION. WE ARE LITERALLY A THIRD WORLD NATION. WE ARE A BANANA REPUBLIC IN SO MANY WAYS AND WE ARE NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ARE STARTING A FREEFALL. BUT FROM TODAY AND FROM THE DAY I TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE, WE WILL RAPIDLY DRIVE PRICES DOWN AND MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AGAIN. UNDER KAMALA HARRIS AND CRICKET JOE BIDEN, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD. YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM ANYMORE, IT'S DEAD. HER RADICAL LIBERAL POLICIES HAVE CAUSED HORRIFIC INFLATION, DECIMATED THE MIDDLE-CLASS, AND GUTTED THE FINANCES OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES. REAL INCOMES ARE DOWN OVER $2000 A YEAR. THAT'S A LOTTA MONEY. THEY ARE DOWN BY THAT, AND IT IS ACTUALLY EVEN MORE IF YOU ADD IN OTHER CATEGORIES, IT IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT. BUT DOWN BY 2000 SINCE SHE TOOK OFFICE AND IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED REAL EARNINGS WERE DOWN ONCE AGAIN AT A RECORD RATE. THE PRICE HIKES HAVE CAUSE -- COST THE TYPICAL HOUSEHOLD $28,000. CONGRATULATIONS. I HOPE EVERYBODY IS HAPPY. [CROWD BOOS] CREDIT CARD DEBT HAS EXPLODED TO THE HIGHEST IT HAS EVER BEEN. THE COST OF A TYPICAL MONTHLY MORTGAGE HAS TRIPLED. PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WE WERE AT ABOUT 2.4% AND NOW YOU'RE UP TO 10% AND EVEN 11% BUT YOU ARE REALLY NOT THERE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THE MONEY EVEN IF YOU WANT TO PAY IT. IN JULY ALONE 350,000 PEOPLE WERE ADDED TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS. KAMALA HARRIS WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HER FANTASIES, AND THEY ARE FAN -- EVERYTI ARE FAN -- EVERYTHING SHE SAYS. EVERYTHING I SAY I'M GOING TO DO, SHE SAYS SHE IS GOING TO DO IT TO. SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THESE FANTASIES, BUT REALLY WHAT SHE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN IS THE PRESENT SUFFERING SHE HAS CAUSED ALONG WITH JOE BIDEN. BY THE WAY, THEY ARE A TEAM. SHE IS TRYING TO THROW HIM OVERBOARD. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK HIM ANYMORE. SHE SAYS LET'S NOT BRING THIS GUY IN. LET'S NOT BRING HIM IN. NO NO, THEY WERE A TEAM. HE APPOINTED HER AS BORDERS ARE AND SHE DID THE -- AS BORDER CZAR AND SHE DID THE WORST JOB ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. DOES ANYONE HERE FEEL RICHER THAN YOU DID UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? IS ANYTHING LESS EXPENSIVE UNDER KAMALA HARRIS AND CROOKED JOE? WE HAD INFLATION, I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE EVER HAD INFLATION LIKE THAT. YOU CAN GO BACK A LONG WAY. ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW WITH HARRIS AND BIDEN THEN 2OU 2ERE WITH 2 2ERSON NAMED PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP? YOU KNOW HIM? HE'S A NICE GENTLEMAN. WITH FOUR MORE YEARS OF HARRIS YOUR FINANCES WILL NEVER RECOVER. THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO RECOVER. OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER RECOVER, FRANKLY. IT WILL BE UNRECOVERABLE. VOTE TRUMP, YOUR SAVINGS WILL GROW, YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME, AND WE WILL BRING BACK THE AMERICAN DREAM BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [CROWD CHANTING "TRUMP"] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. LOOK AT THIS. WE HAVE A LOT OF FRONT ROW JOES HERE. WOW. WHAT A GREAT GROUP OF PATRIOTS THEY ARE. I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THEY HAVE 219 OR 220. THIS ISN'T A RALLY, BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF A THING TODAY. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ONE SUBJECT, AND THEN WE WILL START GOING BACK TO THE OTHER, BECAUSE WE SORT OF LOVE THAT, DON'T WE? NO, IT'S IMPORTANT. THEY SAY IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT. I AM NOT SURE IT IS BUT THEY SAY IT IS. INFLATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT THAT IS PART OF ECONOMY. KAMALA HARRIS WANTS TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE ENTIRE U.S. ECONOMY BUT NEITHER SHE NOR HER RUNNING MATE -- ANOTHER BEAUTY, ISN'T HE? HE SIGNED A BILL. HE WANTS TAMPONS IN BOYS BATHROOMS. I DON'T THINK SO. [CROWD BOOS] BUT THEY'VE NEVER HELD A PRIVATE SECTOR JOB IN THEIR ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL CAREERS. IT'S NO WONDER THEY ARE BOTH SOCIALISTS. THEY ARE ACTUALLY BEYOND SOCIALISTS. I THINK THEY SKIPPED OVER SOCIALISTS. THAT'S WHY I THINK WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT -- BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. I THINK WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE, THEY DON'T DO WELL IN THE ELECTION. THEY HAVE DESTROYED THIS COUNTRY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SAN FRANCISCO. AND SHE WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED IT. YEARS AGO SHE WAS DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THEN SHE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS A DISASTER NOW. NOW, GAVIN NEWSOM HASN'T HELPED VERY MUCH, BUT IT'S A DISASTER. SHE WAS THE ONE. THIS NOVEMBER VOTERS ARE GOING TO GIVE RADICAL LIBERAL KAMALA HARRIS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY SOMETHING NEW. A REAL JOB IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIFE. NICE. KAMALA HAS DECLARED THAT TACKLING INFLATION WILL BE A DAY ONE PRIORITY. THINK OF IT FOR HER. BUT DAY ONE FOR KAMALA WAS 3.5 YEARS AGO. WHY HASN'T SHE DONE IT? I KEEP SAYING, AHH, SHE'S ONE OF THESE COMPLAINERS, LIKE A CRITIC. I REMEMBER GROWING UP, I WOULD SEE PLAYS ON BROADWAY AND GO TO OTHER THINGS AND YOU DOES HAVE CRITICS, THEY CRITICIZED. THEY WERE CRITICAL, CRITICAL. BUT THEY NEVER DID IT THEMSELVES. SHE'S A CRITIC, SHE NEVER DID ANYTHING. NOTHING SHE EVER DID WORKED. AND SHE GOT LUCKY WITH THIS. SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE OUT. 22 PEOPLE I HEAR. JUST ASK AND I SAID, THAT MANY? A LOT OF PEOPLE. SHE NEVER MADE IT TO IOWA, THE GREAT STATE OF IOWA. SHE WAS THE FIRST ONE OUT. SHE HAD A LACK OF SKILL AND PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HER AND NOW SHE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND SHE NEVER GOT ONE VOTE. THINK ABOUT THAT. WHEN KAMALA LAYS OUT HER FAKE ECONOMIC PLAN THIS WEEK, IT WILL PROBABLY BE A COPY OF MY PLAN BECAUSE BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES. JUST REMEMBER IT SHE GOES TO WORK EVERY MORNING IN THE WEST WING, HER DESK IS 10 STEPS FROM THE OVAL OFFICE. SHE CASTS THE TIE-BREAKING VOTES WHICH GAVE US RECORD INFLATION AND FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS KAMALA HAS CACKLED AS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BURNED. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT LAUGH? I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT LAUGH IN WEEKS. THAT'S WHY SHE DISAPPEARED. THAT'S THE LAUGH OF A CRAZY PERSON, I WILL TELL YOU. SHE'S 2RAZY. SHE'S CRAZY. THEY TOLD HER, DON'T LAUGH. DON'T LAUGH. YOU KNOW -- NO, HER LAUGH IS CAREER THREATENING. SHE DOESN'T LAUGH ANYMORE. IT'S SMART, BUT SOMEDAY IT'S GOING TO COME OUT. THAT'S THE LAUGH OF A PERSON WITH SOME BIG PROBLEMS. SHE SAYS HER PLAN IS GOING TO BE AND BRING DOWN PRICES. SHE THINKS SHE IS GOING TO BRING DOWN PRICES. THEN WHY -- HERE'S A SIMPLE LITTLE FEW WORDS. WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT, KAMALA? YOU'VE BEEN THERE 3.5 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU DOING IT NOW? YOU COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW. I COULD SAY THAT WITH EVERYTHING, WHY HASN'T SHE SECURED THE BORDER? SHE WAS THE BORDER CZAR, IT WAS A BIG DEAL. SHE SAYS NOW SHE WAS NOT THE BORDER CZAR. IT'S OK, SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE BORDER, CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT. THIS WAS THE WORST BORDER IN HISTORY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BORDER IN THE WORLD LIKE THIS. WHY HASN'T SHE BROUGHT BACK THE JOBS? SHE SAYS SHE IS GOING TO COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN. SHE HAS BEEN THERE FOR 3.5 YEARS WITH A MAN WHO, FRANKLY, SHE DEFRAUDED, BECAUSE SHE DID NOT TELL YOU ABOUT THAT MAN. I EXPOSED HIM DURING THE DEBATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [CHEERS] NOW THE BOMBSD NOW THE BOMBS ARE STARTING TO DROP IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. ISRAEL WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. UKRAINE WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED WITH RUSSIA. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE EVER HAD AN EMBARRASSMENT LIKE THAT AFGHANISTAN DISASTER. ONE OF THE WORST, MOST EMBARRASSING DAY IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. INFLATION WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. IT WAS CAUSED BY A VERY STUPID ENERGY POLICY. THEN IT WENT BACK TO MY POLICY BECAUSE PRICES WERE GOING UP SO MUCH. IF THEY WON THIS ELECTION, ON DAY ONE ALL OF THAT WOULD END AND THIS COUNTRY WOULD GO THROUGH HELL AND IT WOULD NEVER COME BACK. ONCE IT GOES, IT IS PRETTY FAR DOWN ALREADY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD. WHEN YOU LET 20 MILLION PEOPLE COME INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM PLACES UNKNOWN, AND FROM PRISONS AND FROM MENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND TERRORISTS. KAMALA HARRIS WON'T END THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, SHE WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE. AND WHY HASN'T SHE DONE IT? SHE'S DOING A PLAN, SHE'S GOING TO ANNOUNCE IT THIS WEEK, MAYBE. SHE'S WAITING FOR ME TO ANNOUNCE IT SO SHE CAN COPY IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LIKE, REMEMBER A COUPLE DAYS AGO, AND WE WILL HAVE NO TAX ON TIPS. I SAID, THAT WAS MY PLAN. NOT ONLY DIDN'T SHE, I MEAN, THEY CAME AFTER A PLAN TO GO AFTER ALL THESE PEOPLE VIOLENTLY. SHE WILL COPY A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO. BUT SHE WILL NEVER DO THEM. SHE WILL NEVER DO THEM. SHE WILL SAY THEM FOR THE ELECTION BUT SHE WILL NEVER DO THEM. SHE CAN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE SHE REALLY IS THE PROBLEM. SHE REALLY IS. PEOPLE LIKE HER. WHEN I LEFT OFFIVE, I -- OFFICE, I HANDED JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS A SURGING ECONOMY. GASOLINE HAD REACHED $1.87 A GALLONG, AND FOR PERIODS OF TIME WAS EVEN LOWER THAN THAT. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY RATE WAS DOWN 7%. THE HISPANIC AMERICAN POVERTY RATE WAS DOWN 8% THE BIGGEST DROPS THE GREATEST DROPS HAVE EVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY. EVERY GROUP. MEN, WOMEN, THIS BEIGE -- HISPANICS, ASIANS, BLACKS. WE HAD SOME OF THE GREATEST PERIODS OF ECONOMIC 2ROWTH 2ND HEALTH 2NY 2OUNTRY 2AS 2VER SEEN, I THINK PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. IN FOUR SHORT YEARS UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP WE PASSED THE LARGEST CAT -- TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. WE UNLEASHED AMERICAN ENERGY AND REAL INCOME SURGED BY MORE THAN $4200 IN JUST A SHORT NUMBER OF MONTHS. I MEAN, IT WAS -- NOBODY, YOU NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD. NOW YOU ARE NOT DOING SO WELL, I ADMIT IT. WE HAVE THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A COUNTRY THAT HAD AN ECONOMY LIKE US. I GAVE HARRIS AND BIDEN AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE AND THEY QUICKLY TURNED IT INTO AN ECONOMIC NIGHTMARE WITH A NATION WRECKING AGENDA RIPPED STRAIGHT OUT OF KAMALA'S SAN FRANCISCO LIBERAL PLAYBOOK. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO POLLUTE -- POOR SAN FRANCISCO. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO BRING THAT BACK. THEY FLEW OPEN OUR BORDERS AND FLOODED THE COUNTRY WITH MIGRANT WORKERS, PASSED THE GREEN NEW SCAM, RACKED UP ALMOST $10 TRILLION IN DEBT AND BURIED OUR WORKERS IN JOB KILLING REGULATIONS, COSTING $10,000 PER FAMILY. THAT'S A LOTTA MONEY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT A HARRIS PRESIDENCY WOULD LOOK LIKE. YOU ARE LIVING THROUGH THE MISERY RIGHT NOW, EXCEPT IT WILL GET WORSE. AND YOU ARE PAYING THE PRICE, A PRICE LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER PAID. AND WE ARE DISRESPECTED ALL OVER THE WORLD AS A COUNTRY. WE WERE RESPECTED BEFORE. PUTIN RESPECTED US. PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA RESPECTED US. KIM JONG-UN OF NORTH KOREA RESPECTED US. WE WERE RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD. TODAY WE ARE BEING LAUGHED AT. TODAY WE'RE BEING LAUGHED AT ALL OVER THE WORLD. YOU ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR KAMALA'S LIBERAL EXTREMISM AT THE GAS PUMP, AT THE GROCERY COUNTER AND ON YOUR MORTGAGE BILL. AND EVERYTHING ELSE. HOW IS YOUR CAR INSURANCE DOING? I SAW TODAY IT IS UP LIKE 82%. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THIS INCOMPETENT SOCIALIST LUNATIC KEEP BREAKING OUR ECONOMY FOR FOUR MORE YEARS. IT WILL DESTROY OUR ECONOMY. ON ELECTION DAY WE ARE GOING TO TELL HER THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH, THAT WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, KAMALA. YOU'RE DOING A HORRIBLE JOB. YOU WERE A TERRIBLE ATTORNEY GENERAL, YOU WERE A TERRIBLE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, YOU ARE THE WORST VICE PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. KAMALA! YOU'RE FIRED! GO, GET OUTTA HERE! [CHEERS] GET HER OUT! BOOM. THANK YOU. [CROWD CHANTING "TRUMP"] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAS NOT A PLEASANT DAY. I TELL YOU, FRONT ROW JOES WERE THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN IT ALL, HAVEN'T YOU? THAT WAS A HORRIBLE DAY. THAT WAS A TERRIBLE DAY. SHE'S FLIP-FLOPPING ON EVERY SINGLE THING SHE'S EVER ESPOUSED OR BELIEVED IN. THE BORDER, HEALTH CARE, CRIME. BUT YOU TRULY IS A RADICAL. SHE'S FLIP-FLOPPING ON EVERYTHING TO GET ELECTED. ONCE SHE GETS ELECTED IT WILL ALL GO BACK TO WHERE IT WAS. SHE REFUSES TO DO ANY INTERVIEWS OR PRESS CONFERENCES, ALMOST 30 DAYS NOW, SHE HAS NOT DONE AN INTERVIEW. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S NOT SMART. SHE'S NOT INTELLIGENT. AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH ENOUGH OF THAT WITH THIS GUY, CROOKED JOE. HE DIDN'T DO ANY INTERVIEWS EITHER. THEY KEPT HIM IN HIS BASEMENT AND ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE KEEPING HER IN THE BASEMENT THE SAME WAY THEY KEPT HIM. THEY DON'T WANT TO EXPOSE HER TO LIKE, A QUESTION. LIKE, UHH, WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER TONIGHT? REMEMBER JOE, WHAT KIND OF ICE CREAM IS YOUR FAVORITE? VANILLA. OH, I LIKE VANILLA. THAT WAS GEORGE FLOPADOPOLOUS. WITH ME, NO, THEY ASKED ME DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. DID EVERYBODY THE OTHER NIGHT SEE ELON AND ME? IT WAS GREAT. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SHOWS EVER. I MEAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM. I THINK THEY LIKE ME TOO, COME TO THINK OF IT. BUT HE'S GREAT. HE GAVE US HIS FULL ENDORSEMENT, HE'S A GREAT GUY. HE DOESN'T NEED THIS STUFF. WHAT HE WANTS TO SEE IS OUR COUNTRY BE GREAT AGAIN, HE UNDERSTANDS. IT IS VERY HARD FOR HIM TO ENDORSE THE OPPOSING PARTY. IT IS NOT EASY, IT'S VERY HARD. BUT HE REALLY CARES ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, AND HE KNOWS THE OPPOSING PARTY HAS DESTROYED, REALLY DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY, AND WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY, AND PERMANENTLY DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. AND HE CAN'T WATCH THAT. BUT WE HAD A GREAT CHAT FOR 2.5 HOURS. 2.5 HOURS BEING GRILLED BY ELON. WE HAD A GOOD TIME, ACTUALLY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WE LOVE, OUR COUNTRY. MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU LOVE SOMETHING, RIGHT? SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW WHAT SHE IS REALLY FOR, AND THAT WAY SHE CAN CHANGE IT. YOU KNOW, SHE WILL TELL YOU WHAT SHE WANTS AND CHANGE IT THE WAY SHE WANTS IT, AND ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE THE WAY SHE WANTS IT. I MEAN, THE CLOWN THAT SHE PICKED AS A VICE PRESIDENT, THIS GUYS A CLWON -- THIS GUY IS A CLOWN. WHEN MINNEAPOLIS WAS BURNING DOWN, HE DIDN'T WANT TO BRING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. I AM TELLING YOU, IF I DID NOT FORCE IT UPON HIM YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE THIS CITY. REMEMBER CNN STANDING UP, THIS IS A SEASON OF LOVE? THIS IS A VERY PEACEFUL PROTESTS. AND THE WHOLE CITY IS BURNING DOWN BEHIND THEM. THE WHOLE THING, IT LOOKED LIKE WORLD WAR II. SPEAKING OF WORLD WAR III, I WILL KEEP YOU OUT OF WORLD WAR III. HE'S GONNA PUT YOU IN WORLD WAR III. WE'RE VERY CLOSE. YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO BEING IN A WAR, A BIG WAR, A WORLD WAR. YOU ARE VERY CLOSE. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS CLOSE. AND WE HAVE INCOMPETENT PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, GROSSLY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR RUSSIA AND UKRAINE TO GO AT IT. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR ISRAEL TO BE ATTACKED ON OCTOBER 7. IT HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. BUT A POLITICIAN WILL ALWAYS GO BACK TO WHERE THEY STARTED AND NOVEMBER 6 SHE WILL BE A SAN FRANCISCO LIBERAL AGAIN, DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT. I WONDER WHAT SHE DOES AFTER THIS? OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER RECOVER, ESPECIALLY WHEN ADDED TO THE DESTRUCTION THEY HAVE ALREADY CAUSED ALMOST OVER THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEARS. THINK OF IT, THINK OF THE BORDERS. WE HAD THE BEST BORDER. YOU KNOW MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE GRAPH? THAT IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE GRAPH. NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE BEST BORDER, BUT FOR ANOTHER REASON. I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M GLAD I LOOKED AROUND TO LOOK AT IT. I GO, WAH, PEW. THAT'S MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME. EVEN IF IT WAS -- [CHEERS] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EVEN IF IT WERE BAD NUMBERS, NEGATIVE NUMBERS, I STILL THINK IT WOULD BE MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME. IF HARRIS WINS THIS ELECTION, THE RESULT WILL BE A KAMALA ECONOMIC CRASH, A 1929-STYLE DEPRESSION. 1929. WHEN I WIN THE ELECTION WE WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN A BRAND-NEW TRUMP ECONOMIC BOOM/. IT WILL BE A BOOM. WE'RE GONNA TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND SO FAST. MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE ONLY REASON THE STOCK MARKET IS UP IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK I AM GOING TO WIN. DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT? BUT THERE WAS ONE DAY A 2OUPLE OF 2EEKS AGO WHEN THEY WERE NOT THINKING THAT, AND YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. THIS WILL BE A 1929-STYLE CRASH. YOU KNOW, I HAVE ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT MEN IN WALL STREET, I THINK HERE, I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO. WHERE'S SCOTT? THIS MAN, WILL YOU COME UP HERE PLEASE? JUST COME UP HERE FOR A MOMENT. HE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT MEN ON WALL STREET. AND HE'S MADE CERTAIN STATEMENTS -- I WOULD LIKE HIM TO MAKE THEN -- I WOULD LIKE HIM TO MAKE TH N M, BECAUSE I WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF HE MADE THEM THAN ME. BUT NO, HE'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST ON WALL STREET, RESPECTED BY EVERYONE. I AM NOT SURE HE CAN GET THROUGH SECRET SERVICE. IT'S GOTTEN VERY TIGHT. COME ON UP, SCOTT. COME ON UP, SCOTT. COME ON UP HERE. LOOK AT HIM. AND HE'S A NICE LOOKING GUY, TOO. WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF WORDS? COME ON.
THANK YOU, SCOTT. IS HE CENTRAL CASTING? HE'S CENTRAL CASTING. NO, HE'S BEEN VERY STRONG ON THAT. IF THEY GET IN YOUR GOING TO HAVE A 1929-STYLE CRASH. OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT TOO, AND WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR YOU, FOR EVERYBODY. ON MY FIRST DAY BACK IN THE OVAL OFFICE WILL SIGN AN EXEC AT A BORDER DIRECTING EVERY CABINET SECRETARY AND AGENCY HAD TO USE EVERY TOOL AND AUTHORITY AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO DEFEAT INFLATION AND TO BRING CONSUMER PRICES RAPIDLY DOWN. WE'LL DO IT VERY RAPIDLY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COSTS OF GROCERIES, THE COST OF BACON WENT UP FOUR AND FIVE TIMES. BACON. I DON'T ORDER BACON ANYMORE, IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. IT WILL BE A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT EFFORT TO RAISE THE STANDARD OF LIVING AND MAKE AMERICAN LIFE AFFORDABLE AGAIN. IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT THING, BECAUSE IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE. EVEN IF YOU ARE DOING A LITTLE BETTER YOU HAVE LOST ALL YOUR MONEY BECAUSE OF INFLATION. IT HAS BEEN OUTTA CONTROL FOR A LONG TIME. AND DON'T FORGET, IT IS STARTING TO MAYBE GET UNDER CONTROL, BUT YOU ARE ALREADY UP 50%, 60%, 70% IN SO MANY ITEMS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT CAR INSURANCE, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I LOOKED AT THE CAR INSURANCE NUMBERS, IT'S INCREDIBLE. THAT IS JUST ONE OF MANY, YOU CAN GO THROUGH MANY. BUT THE GROCERIES, TO PUT IN SIMPLE TERMS, PEOPLE GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND THEY HAVE LESS THAN HALF A DEAL. IN FACT, I HAVE SOMETHING HERE. I HAVE SOMETHING I WOULD SHOW YOU. WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS. I USED IT ONCE. I HAVE IT, I DO HAVE IT. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS. SO, THESE ARE TIC TACS, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE THE COMPANY, I HAVE NO IDEA. THEY ARE SO LUCKY. THIS IS THE GREATEST COMMERCIAL THEY EVER HAD. BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THIS IS INFLATION. THIS IS TIC TIC. THIS IS TIC TAC. THIS IS. INFLATION. SOMEBODY GAVE ME THIS ONE TODAY. I SAID, I THINK WE WILL PUT IT UP AS AN EXAMPLE OF INFLATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? INFLATION IS DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY. IT'S DESTROYING OUR FAMILIES. WE WILL TARGET EVERYTHING FROM CAR AFFORDABILITY TO HOUSING AFFORDABILITY TO INSURANCE COSTS TO SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. WE HAVE THE WORST SUPPLY CHAIN WE HAVE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. TO THE 2RICE 2F 2RESCRIPTION DRUGS. I WILL INSTRUCT MY CABINET THAT I EXPECT RESULTS WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OR MUCH SOONER THAN THAT. I WOULD SAY THE FIRST SEVEN DAYS. CAR INSURANCE IS UP 70% TO 100%, AND YOU CAN'T GET IT, YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IT. INSURANCE IS UP 50% OR HIGHER. THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS OUT OF CONTROL. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS NEVER BEEN -- WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A SITUATION WITH INSURANCE LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T GET IT NO MATTER WHAT YOU PAY. BUT PRICES WILL COME DOWN, YOU JUST WATCH. THEY WILL COME DOWN AND THEY WILL COME DOWN FAST NOT ONLY WITH INSURANCE, BUT EVERYTHING. AT THE CENTER OF OUR EFFORT TO BRING LIVING UNDER CONTROL, IT WILL BE AN ALL-OUT PUSH TO END THE BIDEN/HARRIS PUSH FOR A THING CALLED AMERICAN ENERGY. WE WILL DRILL, BABY, DRILL. WE'RE GONNA BRING ENERGY PRICES DOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "DRILL BABY DRILL"] THANK YOU. JUST SO YOU KNOW, THEY STOPPED IT, AND IT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT THEY DID. THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE WHOLE PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY, EVEN WITH SUPPLY CHAINS. THEN THEY SAID, OH, GO BACK TO THE TRUMP PLAN NOW. NOW THEY ARE DRILLING. BUT THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION, IF THEY WIN THE ELECTION, THE DRILLING STOPS. THEY ARE ONLY DOING THIS FOR PURPOSES OF GETTING ELECTED. THEY SAID LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT TRUMP WAS DOING. BUT THE PRICES ARE STILL WAY HIGH. YOU SEE $5 GALLON FOR GASOLINEA, AND MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT IN SOME AREAS. AND WE WILL PUT AN WARA BACK INTO SERVICE. IN ALASKA, IT COULD BE THE LARGEST OIL FIELD IN THE WORLD, COULD BE LARGER THAN SAUDI ARABIA, COULD BE LARGER THAN WHAT RUSSIA HAS. REAGAN, RONALD REAGAN, TRIED TO GET IT. GOOD MAN. HE TRIED TO GET IT. BUSH TRIED TO GET. EVERYBODY TRIED TO GET IT. I GOT IT. AND I GOT IT IN DIFFERENT TIMES BECAUSE THEY STOPPED AT ON ENVIRONMENTAL. THEY USE THE ENVIRONMENT TO STOP EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW THAT. WE ARE ALL ENVIRONMENTALISTS. WE WANT CLEAN AIR, WE WANT CLEAN WATER, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. BUT THEY STOPPED IT, AND WE GOT IT GOING. WE GOT IT GOING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. IT WAS ALL SET TO GO. AND IN THE FIRST -- THINK OF THIS, THE FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE THEY STOPPED IT. THEY SAID NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. NOT ONLY GREAT FOR ALASKA, AN INCREDIBLE PLACE, BEAUTIFUL STATE. WOULD'VE BEEN SO GOOD. BUT WORLDWIDE, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SELLING OIL AND GAS ALL OVER THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY WITH ASIA BECAUSE OF WHERE IT'S LOCATED. ASIA, ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY STOPPED IT. BUT WE WILL START IT UP AGAIN VERY SOON. WE WILL GET APPROVED AGAIN VERY QUICK. AND YOUR PRICES ARE GOING TO COME TUMBLING DOWN. YOUR GASOLINE IS GOING TO COME TUMBLING DOWN AND YOUR HEATING BILLS AND COOLING BILLS ARE GOING TO BE COMING DOWN. YOU HAVE PLACES LIKE IN NEW ENGLAND, I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY PUT UP WITH IT. YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST COSTS, ALMOST ANYWHERE. YOUR COST FOR ENERGY, FOR HEAT, FOR AIR CONDITIONING, ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT A PIPELINE THROUGH A SECTION OF NEW YORK THAT DESPERATELY WANTED TO HAPPEN. A VERY POOR AREA. THEY WON'T DO IT. UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, YOU KNOW WHO USED TO DELIVER THEM THE OIL? RUSSIA. RUSSIAN SHIPS WERE PULLING UP TO NEW ENGLAND. UNDER KAMALA'S HIGH-COST ENERGY POLICY KNOWN AS NET ZERO -- YOU KNOW WHAT NET ZERO -- THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS BY THE WAY. ASK HER WHAT IT MEANS. WE ARE GOING TO GO TO A NET ZERO POLICY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? UH, I HAVE NO IDEA. SHE'S ATTEMPTING TO ABOLISH OIL, COAL, AND NATURAL GAS. 84% OF U.S. ENERGY SUPPLY, SHE WANTS IT ENDED. DO YOU THINK THAT IS GOING TO LIFT YOUR PRICES? THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY 84%, AND THE REAL STUFF. THAT'S THE STUFF THAT POWERS THE PLANTS. IT'S NOT WIND THAT GOES AROUND AND AROUND. DARLING, LET'S WATCH THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH TONIGHT. I'M SORRY, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT, THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING, DARLING. WE HAVE NO ELECTRICITY. WE HAVE NO ELECTRICITY, DARLING. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO WATCH TONIGHT. BUT PERHAPS SOMETIMES DURING THE WEEK IT WILL BE BLOWING AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUR TELEVISION GOING. UPON TAKING OFFICE, HAREN AND BIDEN SHUTOWN THE KEYSTONE EXCEL PIPELINE, ISSUED ORDERS TO CLOSE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF EXISTING POWER PLANTS. KAMALA HAS VOWED THAT IF ELECTED, SHE WILL ABSOLUTELY BAN FRACKING. SHE SAID I WILL BAN FRACKING, JUST RECENTLY. THERE WILL BE NO FRACKING. THAT MEANS THAT SHE CAN'T WIN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, BECAUSE PENNSYLVANIA IS ALL ABOUT FRACKING. THAT IS THEIR BIGGEST INDUSTRY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? PENNSYLVANIA, I HOPE YOU ARE WATCHING, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT SHE SAYS AND THAT IS WHAT SHE WILL DO AND THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL GO BACK TO. SHE WANTS TO BAN FRACKING AND SHE HAS WANTED FOR HER ENTIRE CAREER. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET HER DESTROY OUR COUNTRY LIKE THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA LET HER. IF HARRIS GETS IN, ENERGY PRICES WILL SKYROCKET FAR MORE THAN EVEN IN EUROPE. EUROPE IS A BASIC DISASTER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TENDED TO GO A LITTLE BIT WOKE, BUT THAT IS NOW CHANGING. HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING? THAT IS CHANGING. INFLATION WILL SURGE INTO DOUBLE DIGITS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY AND YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE WILL ABSOLUTELY COLLAPSE. YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS GOING TO COLLAPSE UNDER THESE LUNATICS. BY CONTRAST -- SHE SAID IT WHAT HE HAS. WOW. YOU LOOK HEALTHY, THOUGH. YOU LOOK VERY NICE. YOU LOOK VERY NICE. BY CONTRAST, I'M ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT UNDER MY LEADERSHIP, THE UNITED STATES WILL COMMIT TO THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF SLASHING ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY PRICES BY HALF AT LEAST. HALF. [APPLAUSE] WE INTEND TO SLASH PRICES BY HALF WITHIN 12 MONTHS, AT A MAXIMUM 18 MONTHS. AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT YOU WILL SAY, OH WELL, I VOTED FOR HIM. I STILL GOT THEM DOWN A LOT. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO CUT THEM IN HALF AND WE THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER. AND EVERY SINGLE THING THAT I PROMISED, I PRODUCED. EVERY SINGLE THING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU WILL NEVER HAVE HAD ENERGY SO LOW AS YOU WILL UNDER A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN KNOWN AS DONALD J. TRUMP. HAVE YOU HEARD OF HIM? SO WE THINK YOUR ENERGY BILLS WILL BE DOWN BY 50% TO 70%. HOW GOOD WOULD THAT BE FOR A THING CALLED INFLATION? HOW GOOD WILL THAT BE? ENERGY IS SUCH A BIG TOPIC, SUCH A BIG COST, SO POWERFUL, SO BIG. THAT IF YOU HAVE A DOUGHNUT SHOP, YOU HAVE THE OVENS, YOU HAVE A TRUCK THAT DELIVERS THE DOUGHNUTS. WHATEVER YOU DO. YOUR HEATING, YOUR COOLING, EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THAT. THAT IS WHERE THEY REALLY BLEW IT. THEY BLEW IT WITH TOO MUCH BORROWING, THEY BLEW IT WITH WASTING $10 TRILLION ON THE GREAT SCAM IN HISTORY. THERE ARE A LOT OF SCAMS THEY WORKED ON. WHERE IS THE LAPTOP FROM HELL, IS IN AROUND? BUT THEY DID IT BY DOING A LOT OF THINGS. BUT WITH THE ENERGY, IT IS SUCH A BIG TOPIC. NO MATTER WHAT BUSINESS YOU ARE IN, YOU HAVE TO HEAT AND COOL YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED CARS. IT'S SO ENERGY DOMINATED. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL ISSUE RAPID APPROVALS FOR NEW ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE, UNLOCK NEW LANDS FOR DRILLING, AND ACHIEVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND ENERGY DOMINANT. WE WANT ENERGY DOMINANCE ALL MOST IMMEDIATELY. WE WERE ENERGY INDEPENDENT FOUR YEARS 2GO, 2HINK OF IT. TODAY WE ARE GETTING ENERGY FROM VENEZUELA IN THE FORM OF TAR. WE'RE GETTING IT FROM VENEZUELA! TAR. YOU EVER SEE WHAT IT IS TO MAKE OIL OUT OF TAR? THEY HAVE TAR. THEY HAVE A LOT OF TAR. YOU KNOW WHERE THEY MAKE IT? IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. IT IS THE ONLY PLANT IN THE WORLD THAT CAN TAKE THIS MATERIAL AND TURN INTO GASOLINE AND OIL. BUT NO, IT'S TAR. AND THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL. SPEAKING OF THAT JUST FOR A SECOND, VENEZUELA CRIME IS DOWN 72%, BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING ALL OF THEIR CRIMINALS OUT OF CARACAS, OUT OF THE DIFFERENT PLACES. THEIR MENTAL INSTITUTIONS ARE LITERALLY CLOSING UP. THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLE FROM MENTAL AND CETACEANS, PEOPLE FROM PRISONS AND JAILS, TERRORISTS, THEY HAVE TERRORISTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE BRINGING THEM? WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MURDERERS, DRUG DEALERS. AND VENEZUELAN CRIME IS DOWN 72%. BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE. ALL OVER THE WORLD CRIME IS DOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING THEIR CRIMINALS AND PEOPLE FROM MENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND PUTTING THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE HAVE STUPID PEOPLE LIKE KAMALA AND JOE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK TODAY AND YOU LOOK AT A COUPLE OF -- REMEMBER I SAID MIGRANT CRIME WILL BE A BIG SUBJECT, I SAID THAT A YEAR AGO AND EVERYONE SAID, OH NO. DO YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MIGRANT CRIME? THEY MAKE OUR CRIMINALS LOOK LIKE NICE PEOPLE, THEY DO. THESE ARE THE TOUGHEST, THESE ARE THE TOUGHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THE TOUGHEST PEOPLE. WE BUILT 571 MILES OF WALL AS AN EXAMPLE. THEY COULD HAVE -- AND THAT IS MORE THAN I SAID I WAS GOING TO BUILD, WITHIN I WAS GOING TO ADD 200 MILES. WE HAD IT BUILT, AND THEY DIDN'T PUT IT UP. IT WAS ALL THERE READY TO PUT UP. IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THREE WEEKS TO PUT UP, AND THAT IS WHAT I SAID, THEY ACTUALLY WANT OPEN BORDERS. KAMALA WANTS OPEN BORDERS, AND SHE SAID IT FOR 15 YEARS, SHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS. SHE ONLY CHANGED RECENTLY WHEN SHE NOTICED IN A POLL THAT WASN'T PULLING TOO WELL. TO FURTHER COMBAT INFLATION I WILL TERMINATE KAMALA HARRIS'S GREEN NEW SCAM AND RESEND ALL OF THE UNSPENT FUNDS. GIVE ALL OF THE UNSPENT FUNDS BACK TO BUILDING ROADS, BRIDGES, AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S LIKE THROWING -- WHAT SHE DID, WHAT THEY DID IS LIKE THROWING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT THE WINDOW. WE WILL STOP WASTEFUL SPENDING AND BIG GOVERNMENT GIVEAWAYS AND FINALLY STAND UP FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER, WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE I WAS PRESIDENT. WE STOOD UP. WE STOOD UP. WE STOOD UP. I MEAN, PRIOR TO COVID COMING IN, IN HISTORY THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ECONOMY LIKE WE HAD. THEN WHEN COVID CAME IN, WE BUILT A MILITARY, WE DEFEATED ISIS. I DID IT IN EIGHT MONTHS. WE REBUILT THAT WHOLE -- WE DID SO MANY THINGS. AND WE CREATED THE GREATEST ECONOMY. I GET A LOT OF CREDIT ON EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE ECONOMY. WHEN COVID CAME AND WE HAD TO DO CERTAIN THINGS, WE HAD TO DO CERTAIN MOVES. IF WE DIDN'T MAKE THOSE MOVES, SCOTT, AND WE DIDN'T HELP BUSINESSES SURVIVE FOR THAT TIME, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THAT 1929-STYLE DEPRESSION. WE DID A GREAT JOB. THEN WHEN WE HANDED IT TO THEM, THE STOCK MARKET WAS HIGHER THAN IT WAS PREVIOUS TO COVID COMING IN. THINK OF THAT, IT WAS ACTUALLY HIGHER. AND WE HANDED THEM SOMETHING THAT WAS A JEWEL. BY THE WAY, MORE PEOPLE DIED FROM COVID IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AND HE GOT IT WHEN IT WAS ENDING ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH ENDING. SO WE NEVER REALLY GOT THE CREDIT WE DESERVED FOR THAT, WITH THE VENTILATORS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DID, THE OUTFITS, A LOT OF THINGS. WE WERE PRODUCING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN DIFFERENT PLACES, WE HAD MASK FACTORIES OPENING UP, WE HAD EVERYTHING AND WE DID A GOOD 2OB. THEN 2T 2AME BACK AND IT SHOULD HAVE CAME ROARING BACK, BUT THEY REALLY BLEW IT. THEY SPENT SO MUCH MONEY. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY. WHAT THEY HAD TO DO WAS LET OUR ECONOMY TAKE OVER. BUT WE HAD SOME GREAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS THAT DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THE DEMOCRAT GOVERNORS,. NOT SO MUCH. . OUT OF THE TOP 25 AS AN EXAMPLE, CRIME-RIDDEN CITIES, VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS RUN BY DEMOCRATS. THINK OF THAT. TO MAKE BOTH NEW AND USED CARS MORE AFFORDABLE, I WILL END THE BIDEN/HARRIS ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE ON DAY ONE. [APPLAUSE] DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND BY THE WAY, THERE IS A GREAT PLACE FOR ELECTRIC CARS, I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DO GREAT. ELON HAS HEARD ME SAY THAT MANY TIMES, HE STILL ENDORSED ME. I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE. IT IS A QUESTION OF HOW FAR THEY GO AND HOW MUCH THEY COST AND ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS, FACTORS. ELECTRIC CARS HAVE A GREAT PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY GET GASOLINE POWERED CARS, HYBRIDS, MANY DIFFERENT TYPES, DIESEL. THEY WANT TO MAKE TRUCKS ALL ELECTRIC. GOING TO CALIFORNIA, YOU HAVE SIX STOPS. WITH DIESEL, YOU HAVE NO STOPS. THAT'S HARD TO BEAT. COMMON SENSE, WE ARE THE PARTY OF COMMON SENSE. AN ELECTRIC TRUCK WEIGHS 2.5 TIMES MORE THAN WHAT A GASOLINE POWERED TRUCK WEIGHS. YOU WOULD HAVE TO REBUILD EVERY BRIDGE AND TUNNEL IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE. EVERY COUNTRY TOGETHER DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT WOULD COST. THERE IS A GREAT PLACE FOR ELECTRIC, BUT THERE IS A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND BUY WHAT YOU WANT. BUY WHAT YOU WANT. TO FURTHER REDUCE CONSUMER PRICES, I WILL IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATE EVERY SINGLE COSTLY JOB KILLING REGULATIONS THE BIDEN/HARRIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CREATED, AND THEY HAVE CREATED A LOT. REMEMBER I TOOK OUT 12 FOR EVERY ONE I CREATED, AND WE ENDED UP DOING MORE THAN THAT. WE GOT RID OF SO MANY REGULATIONS THAT WERE SO UNNECESSARY. SOME WERE 100 YEARS OLD. IN OUR FIRST TERM THE REGULAR CUT SAVED THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY $11,000. IN MY NEXT TERM, THE TRUMP DIVIDEND WILL BE EVEN LARGER. HE WILL BE A DIVIDEND. BY REPEALING THE BIDEN/HARRIS REGULATORY ONSLAUGHT, WE CAN SAVE AN ESTIMATED $20,000. AND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. $6000, $7000, $8000 A YEAR JUST IN SAVINGS. TO GET TO ECONOMIC RELIEF FOR WORKERS AND FAMILIES WE WILL MAKE ADDITIONAL TAX CUTS. THAT'S WHAT GAVE US THE GREAT ECONOMY. WE'LL MAKE TAX CUTS ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL MET THEM PERMANENT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A THING WHERE THEY WANT TO TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD WHEN THEY EXPIRE, THE TRUMP TAX CUTS, FIVE YEARS, THEY WANT TO LET THEM EXPIRE. THAT MEANS YOUR TAXES WILL GO UP FOUR TIMES. WE WILL DO SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WAS COPIED, VICIOUSLY, RUTHLESSLY COPIED. NO TAX ON TIPS, OK? NO TAX ON TIPS. YOU KNOW, IF THEY WANTED TO DO THAT, WHY DIDN'T THEY DO IT 3.5 YEARS AGO? ACTUALLY IT WAS THE OPPOSITE. THEY HIRED 88,000 IRS AGENTS TO GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE. SO FOR EVERY POSITION THE FAKE NEW KAMALA TAKES DOWN AND ALL OF THESE POSITIONS THREE WEEKS AGO, THE REAL KAMALA SAID THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THE EXACT OPPOSITE. WITH ME, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO TELLS IT LIKE IT IS. YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOMEBODY WHERE I LET YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND. AND YOU CAN VOTE FOR ME OR NOT, BUT YOU NEED THAT, AND YOU NEED CONSISTENCY. AND YOU NEED BRILLIANCE. YOU NEED BRILLIANCE. SHE'S NOT A BRILLIANT PERSON. SHE'S NOT A SMART PERSON. SHE 2S 2OT 2ERY 2MART. BUT IT IS CRAZY, ISN'T IT THOUGH? ISN'T IT CRAZY? SHE WAS SO DISRESPECTED JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND NOW IT'S LIKE, KAMALA, KAMALA. THE FAKE NEWS. THE FAKE NEWS IS A THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY, DON'T KID YOURSELF. [CROWD BOOS] TO HELP SENIORS ON FIXED INCOMES WHO ARE SUFFERING THE RAVAGES OF INFLATION, THERE WILL BE NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY. WE'RE GONNA STOP IT. NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS CRUEL DOUBLE TAXATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS -- AND THIS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME, SHE WILL PROBABLY ANNOUNCE THIS ON FRIDAY TOO. OH LOOK, THEY HAVE A SPY IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT OVER THERE. LET'S SEE, KAMALA, I THINK WE SHOULD DO NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY. BUT IT ONLY CAME INTO EXISTENCE AT 1984 AND AT THAT TIME AND ONLY AFFECTED A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS. BUT NOW NEARLY HALF OF ALL SENIORS HAVE TO PAY. THANKS TO INFLATION UNDER HARRIS , SHE IS HORRIBLE. THIS TAX HITS MORE SENIORS EVERY YEAR, AND THEY CAN'T MAKE IT. THEY CAN'T MAKE IT, THEY ARE FAILING. YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT RIGHT, THEY SAVED, THEY WORKED. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HURT MOST BY THIS KIND OF THINKING AND THIS ECONOMY. WITH YOUR VOTE, I WILL END THIS INJUSTICE AND I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS, JUST AS I DID FOR FOUR INCREDIBLE YEARS. THERE WAS NEVER ANY TALK ABOUT DOING ANYTHING. BY CONTRAST, KAMALA HARRIS HAS A THREE STEP PLAN TO DESTROY MEDICARE AND TO DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY. SHE HAS THROWN OPEN OUR BORDERS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS GOING TO DO? THEY ARE ALL SIGNING UP. CONGRATULATIONS, THEY WILL ALL BE SIGNING UP RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. SHE HAS OPENED UP OUR BORDERS. AGAIN, I BELIEVE IT IS 20 MILLION PEOPLE, BUT I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE WITH THE GOTAWAYS. I HAD A REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY. DO YOU THINK THAT WAS EASY TO GET FROM MEXICO? WHAT I HAD TO DO TO THEM. THEY ENDED IT IMMEDIATELY. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS UNFAIR TO MEXICO, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? MEXICO IS LIKE A RAILROAD TRACK COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS UNFAIR. IT'S NOT UNFAIR. BUT MEXICO AGREED TO IT. REMAIN IN MEXICO. THEY ENDED IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. SECOND, SHE IS FLOODING OUR COUNTRY WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF LOW-WAGE PUBLIC BENEFITS, FREE HEALTH CARE. SHE IS GIVING THEM WHAT OUR MILITARY VETS DON'T GET IT. THEY ARE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS. AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT CAME IN SO ILLEGALLY AND DON'T SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH ARE LIVING IN SOME OF THE MOST LUXURIOUS HOTELS IN THE WORLD. INCREDIBLE. YOU SEE THAT. YOU'VE BEEN SEEING THE STORIES, THEY ARE LIVING IN HOTELS, THE BEST HOTELS. THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THAT THEY CAN GET FROM WEALTHY CUSTOMERS SO THEY SAY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS I THINK WE WILL TAKE THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE MONEY FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAN SOME RICH GUY COMING IN FROM ARGENTINA AND HE WANTS TO MAKES THEM ALL CITIZENS, DUMPING THEM INTO MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY UNTIL THOSE PROGRAMS BUCKLE AND COLLAPSE AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN UNDER THEM SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND OTHER PROGRAMS WILL COLLAPSE. NO COUNTRY CAN SUSTAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THE MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY UNDER A BORDER CZAR HARRIS ARE COMING FROM ALL SORTS OF PLACES, FROM COUNTRIES UNKNOWN, LITERALLY FROM COUNTRIES UNKNOWN, AND THEY AS I SAID THEY ARE COMING IN FROM PRISONS AND MENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND THEY ARE COMING IN AS TERRORISTS WE HAVE MORE TERRORISTS LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT 2OW 2ND NOTHING GOOD 2S GONNA HAPPEN FROM THIS AND NOW IT IS GETTING MORE AND MORE VIOLENT JUST PICK UP THE NEWSPAPERS TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION PEOPLE STOPPED, A WOMAN YESTERDAY RAPE TO NEW YORK, RAPED VICIOUSLY, AND WHEN THEY SAID SHE WAS RAPED YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID, THEY WERE NOT TRYING TO RAPE ME, THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL ME. THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL HER. AND A GENTLEMAN FROM A CERTAIN COUNTRY I WON'T MENTION HAPPEN TO BE IN SOUTH CARE -- SOUTH AMERICA BUT IT IS NOT ONLY SOUTH AMERICA IT IS ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY ARE COMING AND THEY ARE COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, JUST THIS WEEK IN CONEY ISLAND KEMAL AHEAD TWO -- HARRIS HAD TWO MIGRANTS AND THEY WERE ARRESTED FOR THE RAPE OF A 46-YEAR-OLD WOMAN AND THERE WERE A ROUGH SITUATION AND FOUR OR FIVE SITUATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, RAPED AND MURDERED, RAPED AND SOMETHING ELSE AND SOMETIMES JUST IMMEDIATE KILLING, THESE PEOPLE ARE BRUTAL. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT OF THE TOUGHEST JAILS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE CANNOT TAKE THEM, NO COUNTRY CAN SUSTAIN IT. NO COUNTRY. THEY ALL SAID I WAS WRONG WHEN I SAID THAT MIGRANT CRIME WILL REACH EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS AND NOW IT IS MUCH WORSE THAN THAT, IT IS A LOT WORSE THAN EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS, IT IS BEYOND CONTROL, WE HAVE A NEW CATEGORY OF CRIME, IT IS CALLED MIGRANT CRIME AND I THINK IT IS GONNA END UP BEING THE WORST CATEGORY OF ALL, THESE PEOPLE ARE TOUGH, THEY ARE MEAN, THEY ARE ANGRY, AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN OUR COUNTRY AND IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK OUT WELL, THE MIGRANTS THAT HARRIS LET IN OUR RAPING OUR WOMEN ON HURTING OUR CHILDREN AND NOW KAMALA WANTS TO LET THEM PILLAGE OUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN, IT WILL NEVER EVEN GET CLOSE TO HAPPENING IF I AM IN OFFICE AND I THINK YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO PUT ME IN OFFICE BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. IF SHE WINS YOU WILL HAVE MASS AMNESTY AND CITIZENSHIP FOR ALL OF THE BIDEN-HARRIS ILLEGALS THAT HAVE PORTED TO OUR COUNTRY. IF I WHEN YOU HAVE THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY STARTING ON INAUGURATION DAY, 2025. AND YOU KNOW I DO NOT SAY IT HAPPILY BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN EASY SITUATION BUT DWIGHT D BAUER -- DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, DWIGHT EISENHOWER, HE WAS VERY STRONG ON BORDERS ON THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OPERATION WE HAD UNDER DWIGHT EISENHOWER PRESIDENT AND HE UNDERSTOOD IT WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE TO HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COMING THROUGH BUT WHAT HE WENT THROUGH IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH, NO COUNTRY, NO BORDER HAS EVER GONE THROUGH WHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH WHEN THEY ARE DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY IN THE MIGRANT INVASION IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN CRUSHING YOUR WAGES AND DRIVING UP THE COST OF HEALTH CARE AND THE COST OF ALL OF YOUR GOOD. MILLIONS OF UNINSURED ILLEGAL ALIENS ARE GETTING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FREE HEALTH CARE PAID FOR BY AMERICAN CITIZENS ON YOUR MEDICAL BILLS IT IS RIGHT ON YOUR MEDICAL BILLS. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HEAR THIS, YOU GET ANGRY BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM, THEY COME UP IN CARAVANS, I THINK I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME BUT THEY HAVE CARAVANS OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MANY MANY CRIMINALS IN THE CARAVANS VERY BELIEVE -- VERY DANGEROUS UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS FOR THE WOMEN, THE WOMEN IN THE CARAVANS, IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT HAPPENS, IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE CARAVANS COMING UP, IT IS A ROUGH JOURNEY BUT THEY, BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY STUPID PEOPLE HERE WHO SAY IF YOU COME UP, WE WILL GIVE YOU HEALTH CARE, SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAL, SCHOOL, YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOLS IN A LOT OF PLACES ARE NOT, YOU CANNOT EVEN GO ANYMORE, THEY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF OUR STUDENTS, THEY HAVE PEOPLE SITTING IN CHAIRS WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND THEY ARE TAKING THE PLACE OF OUR YOUNG CHILDREN. THE HOSPITALS, A PERSON TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY FROM SAN DIEGO THEY SAID THEY CANNOT GET INTO A HOSPITAL ANYMORE, THE HOSPITALS ARE BEING OCCUPIED BY ILLEGAL AIRILY ENDS, SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE CARE OF HER, THEY ARE BEING OCCUPIED AND THE REASON THEY ARE COMING IS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE GAVIN NEWSOM ARE SAYING COME, IT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM, THEY ARE DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY AND WE CAN'T DO IT, WE CAN'T LET IT CONTINUE, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY IN WHICH PEOPLE LIKE SCOTT, BRILLIANT WALL STREET PEOPLE, THAT IS ALSO COMMON SENSE IT IS ALL ABOUT COMMON SENSE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF COMMON SENSE. [APPLAUSE] SHE WILL PROBABLY CHANGE OVER THE NEXT SHORT TIME, YOU KNOW WE SAID -- ALONG THE BORDER AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID, THEY HAVE TO BE RELEASED, RELEASED, WE ARE GONNA RELEASE THESE ARE MURDERERS, KILLERS, DRUG DEALERS, THE WORST PEOPLE ON EARTH, YOU DO NOT GET MUCH WORSE, SHE SAID NO SHE WILL PROBABLY CHANGE HER MIND ON THAT BUT SHE WANTS TO RELEASE, THIS IS REMEMBER I SAID IT BEFORE, A PERSON THAT IS CONSIDERED FAR MORE LIBERAL BOWL THEN CRAZY BERNIE SANDERS, HE IS CRAZY YOU KNOW AND FAR MORE LIBERAL THEN CRAZY BERNIE. THIS IS CONSIDERED WORSE AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A PRESIDENT LIKE THAT, SOMEONE WHO WAS SAYING LAST NIGHT ON TELEVISION THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE FIND OUT THE WONDERFUL SEAN HANNITY ACTUALLY SAID IT, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM? BUT HE SAID IT BUT EVERYONE IS SAYING IT WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS A VERY LIBERAL PERSON, YOU KNOW THEY USE THE WORD PROGRESSIVE, THEY DO NOT USE LIBERAL ANYMORE THEY USE PROGRESSIVE BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO NICE, PROGRESSIVE MEANS FORWARD THINKING BUT IT IS THE OPPOSITE BUT SHE IS THE MOST LIBERAL SENATOR THAT WE HAVE HAD IN 50, 60 YEARS I THINK PROBABLY EVER BUT ARE MORE LIBERAL THAN CRAZY BERNIE, BY CONTRAST I WILL KEEP THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT UNLESS WE CAN DO SOMETHING MUCH BETTER, WE WILL KEEP IT, IT STINKS, IT IS NOT GOOD, IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING BETTER WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT IF WE CAN DO BETTER MEANING LESS EXPENSIVE AND BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR YOU, LESS EXPENSIVE AND BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR YOU, THEN WE WILL DO IT. WE ARE NOT LOOKING BETTER FOR THE GOVERNMENT, WE ARE LOOKING BETTER FOR YOU. SHE GOES AROUND SAYING, HE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE HEALTH, NO, I AM GOING TO KEEP IT UNLESS WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS BETTER FOR YOU AND LESS EXPENSIVE FOR YOU OTHERWISE WE ARE NOT DOING THAT AND YOU SAW THAT HAVING TO DO WITH SOCIAL SECURITY FOR FOUR YEARS I WAS THERE AND FOR FOUR YEARS I NEVER REACH THE AGE AND THEY ARE GONNA END UP RAISING THE AGE AND I NEVER RAISE YOUR AGE I NEVER DID ANYTHING I LEFT YOUR PLAY IN THE WAY IT WAS, NEVER TOUCHED IT, I WAS THERE FOR FOUR YEARS, SAME THING WITH RUSSIA, THEY SAY HE IS GOING TO START A WAR, FOR FOUR YEARS RUSSIA NEVER WENT INTO UKRAINE. THEY WAITED UNTIL HE GOT OUT AND THEN THE ARMY STARTED TO FORM -- UNTIL I GOT OUT AND THEN ARMY STARTED TO FORM BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO RUSSIA, BUSH LET THEM HAVE A LOT OF LAND, YOU KNOW THAT. OBAMA, PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA, HAVE YOU HEARD OF HIM, HE LET THEM HAVE A LOT OF LAND, NOW YOU HAVE BIDEN WHO WAS LETTING THEM HAVE THE WHOLE THING, OK, THE WHOLE THING AND YET PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHAT DID PUTIN GET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, NOTHING, HE TOOK NOTHING UNDER TRUMP BUT HE TOOK UNDER BUSH, HE TOOK UNDER OBAMA, BIG, BIG STUFF. IN AND AROUND UKRAINE. BUT HE TOOK NOTHING UNDER TRUMP'S BUT NOW HE HAS TAKEN, NOW HE IS GOING FOR THE BIG ONE AND WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER LOW PRICES, LOW DRUG COSTS, NEW OPTIONS THAT WILL DRAMATICALLY RELEASE THE CRUSHING BURDEN OF AMERICAN PATIENTS, COME JOE TRIED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR $35 INSULIN, YOU KNOW WHO DID THAT, I DID THAT, I DID THE INSULIN AND IT KICKED OUT AND YOU KNOW I REMEMBER WHEN I DID IT IT HAD TO BE A STATUTE IT WAS A CERTAIN STATUTE THAT TOOK A CERTAIN TIME AND I SAID I HOPE I AM NOT ELECTED BECAUSE SOMEONE WILL DO A -- WILL GET A LOT OF CREDIT FOR DOING WHAT I GOT DONE, I GOT IT DONE, $35 INSULIN AND NOW THEY TAKE CREDIT FOR IT, IT IS TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, THEY TAKE CREDIT FOR A LOT OF THINGS THEY SHOULD NOT BE TAKING CREDIT FOR. THEY SAY CONGRATULATIONS, HE HAS DONE A NICE JOB, CONGRATULATION, THIS INSULIN WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD AND THEY WERE DYING, 35 DOLLARS, NOBODY THINKS THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE BUT THEY COULD SAY LIKE YOU DID A GREAT JOB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU DID A GOOD JOB, BUT INSTEAD, THEY SAY WE BROUGHT IN INSULIN AT $35, IT IS A LIE. THE FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IN ELLA'S -- ALIENS AND FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE, FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY, I AM FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] THE COLOSSAL INFLUX OF MIGRANTS INTO THE CITIES IS DRIVING RENT, RENT ABSOLUTELY THROUGH THE ROOF. AND YOU KNOW WHO IS PAYING THE RENT, THE GOVERNMENT, OUR GOVERNMENT IS PAYING RENT, WE ARE PAYING GOBBLERS THAT WERE NOT OBTAINABLE IN FACT IF I GO BACK INTO THE BUSINESS THERE ARE BUILDINGS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND I WILL CHARGE THE GOVERNMENT THE HIGHEST RENTS YOU HAVE EVER SEEN, THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING, LANDLORDS ARE GETTING A LOT OF MONEY WHICH IS WHY SOME OF THE LUXURY HOTELS ARE GOING TO MIGRANT THEY CAN MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY RENTING TO A A MIGRANT THAN WEALTHY PEOPLE WHICH IS WHY AS PRESIDENT I WILL SEAL THE BORDER AND SEND THEM ALL BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES WHERE THEY BELONG AND PRICES WILL COME DOWN AND COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY AND COME DOWN FAST. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS, WE WILL WORK WITH STATES LIKE NEVADA, GREAT STATE, WE WERE LEAVING BIG AND THE POLE THEY ARE BY THE WAY THANK YOU GOVERNOR, TO OPEN UP LARGE TRACTS OF FEDERAL LAND FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTIONS AND SIMILAR TO OPPORTUNITIES WITH SENATOR KRIM -- TIM SCOTT, A GREAT GUY, SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, CAME IN AND SAID I DO HAVE THIS IDEA AND HE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME BUT HE COULD NEVER GET A PERSON TO EXECUTE IT AND I DID IT AND OPPORTUNITIES ON ONE OF THE GREATEST, ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, I GIVE TIM SCOTT A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT IN THESE AREAS WILL HAVE LOW TAX, LOW REGULATION TO STIMULATE RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH, MAXIMUM AFFORDABILITY AND THE RETURN OF A THING CALLED WHICH I ALWAYS COME BACK TO, THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE WE HAVE LOST THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE WILL BRING BACK OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. YOU KNOW, SUPPLY CHAINS WERE BASIC, IT WAS AUTOMATIC, YOU HAVE A THING AND IT YOU 2ET 2T FROM HERE TO HEAR AND WHEN THIS LUNATIC BECAME PRESIDENT COME UP WITH HER, REMEMBER SHE WAS THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY BUT SHE WAS LIKE SILENT BECAUSE SHE WAS, I DON'T KNOW, NOBODY RESPECTED HER UNTIL SHE WAS THE ONLY CHOICE LEFT. THEY COULDN'T GET ANYBODY ELSE. DID YOU SEE WHERE THEY HAD THE 12 MOST LIKELY PEOPLE TO BE CHOSEN AFTER BIDEN AND SHE WAS RANKED NUMBER LAST BUT SHE IS THE ONE WHO WAS PICKED, SHE WAS RANKED, SHE WAS RANKED BELOW TO HIM, HE WAS SECOND TO LAST I THINK. WE WILL BRING BACK OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, WE WILL BRING BACK OUR SUPPLY CHAINS AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK FROM CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES, THOSE ARE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK, WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK FAST AS WE REDUCE BURDENS ON DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, AMERICAN WORKERS WILL MAKE OUR GOODS BETTER AND CHEAPER AND IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S. SO, RIGHT HERE IN A PLACE CALLED NORTH CAROLINA, HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT?
